# Setup new repository
## Setup repository on github webpage

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Log in to your account.
- Click the new repository button in the top-right. 
- You have an option to initialize a repository with a README file. But I do that from the command line so I do not select this option. 
- Just hit the "Create repository" button.

## Setup github repository locally

- Go to the directory where you save your github repostories
- Copy the location from the clone/download button of the repository on the github webpage here it is `git clone git@github.com:statOmics/dockerPageExample.git`
- Type `git clone git@github.com:statOmics/dockerPageExample.git`
- Write some code.
- Type `git add .` to add the files (see the typical use page).
- Type `git commit -m "first commit"` to commit your your changes to github. The -m flag is used to add the message "first commit" to indicate the changes that you add
- Type `git push origin` to add the files to your github account

# Add webpage
## Initialize Webpage
- You can add a webpage from a directory in the master branch, but I prefer to do it in a separate gh-pages branch 

- Type `git checkout --orphan gh-pages` to create a new gh-pages branch.

- I typically delete everything and copy the website from another repository. I use the template on https://github.com/GTPB/Web_course_template. So I download the repository and unzip it in my download folder and copy it to the gh-pages branch that is now open in my locale git repository

```
cp -r ~/Downloads/Web_course_template-master/* .
```
